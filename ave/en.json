It’s highly unusual, the kind you rarely find in books or films. For more than six years we kept it between the people who lived through it, but now I’m speaking up and trying to make it known. I adapted the story into two formats: a documentary version and a fantastical reimagining. The documentary is for meeting <i>The Real Unreal Story</i> as it is, without distortion. The fantastical format is for a visual, metaphor-driven way to feel the events.</p></div>",

It’s a factual chronicle told straight, focused on people, agency, and the chain of choices under uncertainty.</p></div>",

Based on the documentary narrative <i>The Real Unreal Story</i> and presented as its reimagining. Oncology is the Power Devourer; side effects and crises are monsters; supers are people who already possess abilities. The Devourer latches onto supers, places a beacon mark on them, drains strength and life energy to the point of death, and attracts monsters. This isn’t a story about magic, but about endurance — about those who keep the door open when everything shrinks to a point.</p></div>",
