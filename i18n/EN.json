  "modal.tile1.body": "<div class=\"rtxt\"><p class=\"indent\">My name is Nico. I am a friend of Adam — a person who has been living in a difficult situation for many years: because of serious health issues and because of legal pressure from some of his relatives. I do my best to support him in every possible way.</p><p class=\"indent\">Over the years, many unusual and difficult events have unfolded around Adam and his circle. By mid-2025 I realized that all of this forms a single story — The Real Unreal Story. With this story, it is time to reach a wider audience and openly welcome any kind of support — attention, feedback, sharing of information, participation.</p><p class=\"indent\">My task is not to “tell it once,” but to keep a living chronicle: to reveal the nature of the characters, their traits and decisions; to explain the context; to record what happens and why. I will update events in real time so that those who follow us see not a post-factum retelling, but a living picture of what is happening.</p></div>",
  "modal.tile2.body": "<div class=\"rtxt\"><p class=\"indent\">Adam is a person of deep empathy and a surgeon with unique techniques, well-known and highly regarded in professional circles. Since 2019 he has repeatedly faced hematologic malignancies: periods of remission alternated with relapses, and secondary forms emerged. Over this time he has completed five lines of therapy — a rare and difficult path in itself; in July 2025 a sixth line of treatment was started.</p><p class=\"indent\">In parallel with his health situation, prolonged legal pressure from part of his relatives has been constraining him. This limits his freedom of action, access to resources, and the ability to organize treatment and daily life. The combination — illness, multiple courses of therapy, and external constraints — makes the situation especially hard and calls for support: informational, professional, organizational, and human.</p></div>",
  "modal.tile3.body": "<div class=\"rtxt\"><p class=\"indent\">Around Adam there has been, and remains, a group of people who sincerely and selflessly supported him in a truly difficult and unusual situation. Among them are those who were there even before the legal pressure began, and those who appeared later. Each has their own character, motives, and decisions; together they form a context without which The Real Unreal Story would be incomplete. Their actions directly affected Adam’s fate.</p><p class=\"indent\">These people are part of the larger picture; each person’s contribution is visible in how the plot develops and in the way this story is told. The support for Adam and years of interactions with them formed the basis for presenting what is happening as a coherent narrative — with Adam and those who stood by.</p></div>",

In parallel I develop the story across formats — writing, fact-checking, translating, creating visuals and audio — and keep the site running.</p><p>Your voluntary contribution matters: it sustains the work on the project (research, texts, translations, visuals and audio, publications, hosting, tech support) and helps cover expenses that arise directly from this story. That way I can keep the pace of work and care around it.</p><p><strong>Next — learning and tools.</strong><br>— practical courses: AI practice, content and web architecture, bots and automations, AI avatars;<br>— web apps (some features free): image stylization and comics, realistic photo/video, melodies and music, etc.</p><p>Stay tuned: even if today isn’t the moment to donate, check back — there will be updates and releases here. Reposts help a lot too.</p></div>"
