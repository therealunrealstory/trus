In parallel I develop the story across formats — writing, fact-checking, translating, creating visuals and audio — and keep the site running.</p><p>Your voluntary contribution matters: it sustains the work on the project (research, texts, translations, visuals and audio, publications, hosting, tech support) and helps cover expenses that arise directly from this story. That way I can keep the pace of work and care around it.</p><p><strong>Next — learning and tools.</strong><br>— practical courses: AI practice, content and web architecture, bots and automations, AI avatars;<br>— web apps (some features free): image stylization and comics, realistic photo/video, melodies and music, etc.</p><p>Stay tuned: even if today isn’t the moment to donate, check back — there will be updates and releases here. Reposts help a lot too.</p></div>"
