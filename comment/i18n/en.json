  "full": "<p>Thank you for exploring The Real Unreal Story. This story is true. I was inside the events — mainly via messages with participants — and I can document details with screenshots and commentary. I will publish these materials not as part of the literary text but as documentary notes to show context, emotions, and real human behavior.</p><p>Because this is my personal layer of interaction, I’ll post screenshots and analyses in my Instagram and Telegram channels. It’s an author’s view, not the fabric of the narrative, and it helps explain why the story is unusual and why it deserves to be heard. Adam and other participants deserve this.</p><p>The current release is an “axial” version: I intentionally removed many scenes and most dialogues to guide you along the spine of events. Each chapter has a single cover — a still or a short one-scene video — because right now the priority is the core of the story. After the base release, I’ll expand episodes with dialogues, emotions, and full visual scenes, revealing intertwined events more clearly. A separate task is ultra-realistic videos focused on people: character, speech, worldview. I want to show not just mechanics, but persons — Adam and everyone inside this story.</p><p>My priority now is simple: help Adam endure the next stage. That’s why I’m telling the story publicly, recording what happens next, and revealing more about earlier chapters, bringing the material to life with modern visualization.</p><p>I’m building a connected ecosystem — text, visuals, and audio — so the material is not only informative but well-crafted: not for content’s sake, but for Adam and others — dignified, responsible, empathetic people who deserve to be heard and “seen,” even retrospectively, but honestly and carefully.</p><p>Most materials are created with AI, which only recently became capable enough. Over months I developed my own methods rather than relying on “standard” generators. In time, I plan to open access to tools and, possibly, learning materials — all practice-based. If AI craft interests you and you resonate with the results here, stay with us: I’ll share principles and workflows.</p><p>As of early October, some social channels aren’t yet fully shaped: the workload is large, and I prioritize the multilingual, flexible website. Thanks for your patience — I choose quality over speed, and the social channels will unfold their intended ideas.</p><p>In parallel, I’m preparing other formats — several chapters already exist as a comic; I’ll decide where to present it when it’s ready. The story is too big and unusual for a single form — I want it to reach different audiences.</p><p><strong>Every bit of support matters.</strong> Subscribing to Instagram and Telegram, checking the site, and following updates all help Adam and tell us you’re with us. Thank you for staying.</p>",
